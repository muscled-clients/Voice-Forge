## 🎯 **Effective Prompting Strategies Used**

### **1. Incremental Development**
```
✅ Good: "Add YouTube transcription to the existing audio transcription API"
❌ Bad: "Build a complete transcription platform with all features"
```

### **2. Specific Problem Statements**
```
✅ Good: "I'm getting a WebSocket connection error when streaming audio. The connection drops after 30 seconds."
❌ Bad: "Fix the streaming feature"
```

### **3. Context Preservation**
```
✅ Good: "In the existing VoiceForge API, add authentication to the developer portal we built last session"
❌ Bad: "Add authentication" (without context)
```

### **4. Technical Constraints**
```
✅ Good: "Use PostgreSQL for the database and SQLAlchemy for ORM. Keep the existing FastAPI structure."
❌ Bad: "Add a database" (without technical specifications)
```

### **5. User Experience Focus**
```
✅ Good: "When users upload files, show a progress bar and processing status. Handle errors gracefully with clear messages."
❌ Bad: "Make the upload work better"
```
