#### **AI Response Summary:**
- Conducted comprehensive audit of Python SDK at `D:\Projects\STT\sdk\python\`
- Found complete SDK structure with VoiceForgeClient, models, and examples
- Identified SDK exists but needs publishing to PyPI
- Discovered YouTube transcription method already implemented in SDK
- Created detailed SDK status documentation

#### **Outcome:**
- ✅ Confirmed Python SDK exists and is well-structured
- ✅ SDK supports file transcription and YouTube transcription
- ❌ SDK not published to PyPI yet (users can't `pip install voiceforge-python`)
- ⚠️ Some SDK features need alignment with current API

---

### Phase 7: API Endpoint Comprehensive Audit
**Session Date:** Current session continuation

#### **User Prompt:**
> "this sdk will support will invlove all the api's transcrbe auido ,youtube to text ,real time voice to text and record and text ? and do the devloper portal also have all endpoitns in docs ?"

#### **AI Response Summary:**
- Conducted complete audit of actual vs documented API endpoints
- Analyzed playground functionality vs available APIs
- Created comprehensive API analysis document
- Found all major features ARE implemented and working:
  - File transcription ✅
  - YouTube transcription ✅  
  - WebSocket real-time streaming ✅
  - Authentication system ✅
  - Usage analytics ✅

#### **Outcome:**
- ✅ Confirmed all major API functionality is working
- ✅ Created comprehensive API audit report
- ❌ Documentation gaps identified (missing YouTube and WebSocket docs)
- ❌ Search functionality in docs not working
- 🎯 Core API is more complete than initially realized
